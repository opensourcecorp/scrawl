`[ In Progress during development ]`

`scrawl` is a simple tool for taking notes with tag search support. It is
designed to be run entirely locally, and in the future will also have a
self-contained sync mechanism for syncing your notes across devices.

## Installation

`scrawl` is distributed as a single Go binary, and can be easily installed a
number of ways.

### Download Releases

The easiest way to get `scrawl` is to download the latest release from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/opensourcecorp/scrawl/releases), and
extract the `scrawl` binary to somewhere on your `PATH`, e.g.
`/usr/local/bin`.

### Install from Source

If you have a working Go 1.17+ environment, you can install with `go` itself:

    go install github.com/opensourcecorp/scrawl@<latest|vX.Y.Z>

## Usage

### CLI Options

## Roadmap Notes
