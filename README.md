`[ In Progress during development ]`

`scrawl` is a simple tool for taking Markdown-driven notes. It can either be run
entirely locally, or set up to sync with a remote server that YOU control -- no
options for paid hosting, and no extra cost for the tool & its functionality.

## Installation

`scrawl` is distributed as a single Go binary, and can be easily installed a
number of ways.

### Download Releases

The easiest way to get `scrawl` is to download the latest release from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/opensourcecorp/scrawl/releases), and
extract the `scrawl` binary to somewhere on your `PATH`, e.g.
`/usr/local/bin`.

### Install from Source

If you have a working Go 1.17+ environment, you can install with `go` itself:

    go install github.com/opensourcecorp/scrawl@<latest|vX.Y.Z>

## Usage

TBD.

### CLI Options

## Roadmap Notes
